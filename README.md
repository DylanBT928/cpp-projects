- [Caesar Cipher](./programs/Caesar%20Cipher/CaesarCipher.cpp) - An encoder and decoded for the Caesar Cipher, a method in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by another letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

- [Calculator](./programs/Calculator/Calculator.cpp) - A simple calculator that includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and percentage.

- [Fibonacci Sequence](./programs/Fibonacci%20Sequence/FibonacciSequence.cpp) - A mathematical sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

- [FizzBuzz](./programs/Fizz%20Buzz/FizzBuzz.cpp) - A group word game that prints integers from 1 to 100. If the number is divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz"; if the number is divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz"; and if both conditions are met, the output is "FizzBuzz."

- [Guess the Number](./programs/Guess%20the%20Number/GuessTheNumber.cpp) - The user must guess a mystery number and receive feedback on whether their guess is higher or lower than the mystery number.

- [Hangman](./programs/Hangman/Hangman.cpp) - A classic game in which the user must solve a secret word by guessing letters within a certain number of tries.

- [Luhn Algorithm](./programs/Luhn%20Algorithm/LuhnAlgorithm.cpp) - Determines whether the identification number provided by a user is accurate. The algorithm is most notably used in credit cards, IMEI, or SSN.

- [Rock Paper Scissors](./programs/Rock%20Paper%20Scissors/RockPaperScissors.cpp) - An intransitive hang game in which each player forms one of three shapes with their hand.

- [Temperature Converter](./programs/Temperature%20Converter/TemperatureConverter.cpp) - Converts an inputted temperature between 3 different temperature scales: Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin.

- [Tetris](./programs/Tetris/Tetris.cpp) - A puzzle video game that allows players to rotate falling blocks strategically to clear levels.

- [Tic-Tac-Toe](./programs/Tic-Tac-Toe/TicTacToe.cpp) - A simple game in which a user must win by getting 3 in a row with their shape: X or O.
