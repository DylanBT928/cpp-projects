# Small Projects ðŸ“‹
A list of quick and easy projects that were programmed by me.

## Programs
- [Body Mass Index](./programs/Body%20Mass%20Index/bodyMassIndex.cpp) - Calculates the measurement of body fat based on the height and weight inputted.
- [Bulls and Cows](./programs/Bulls%20and%20Cows/bullsAndCows.cpp) - The user must guess a secret 4-digit number and be given 4 bulls. A cow means that a digit is correct, but in the wrong position, and a bull is a correct digit and correct position.
- [Caesar Cipher](./programs/Caesar%20Cipher/CaesarCipher.cpp) - An encoder and decoded for the Caesar Cipher, a method in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by another letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
- [Calculator](./programs/Calculator/Calculator.cpp) - A simple calculator that includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and percentage.
- [Change Return](./programs/Change%20Return/ChangeReturn.cpp) - Calculates how much change is owed after a customer pays.
- [Factor Finder](./programs/Factor%20Finder/FactorFinder.cpp) - Finds all the possible factors of an inputted number or determines if it is a prime number.
- [Fibonacci Sequence](./programs/Fibonacci%20Sequence/FibonacciSequence.cpp) - A mathematical sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
- [FizzBuzz](./programs/Fizz%20Buzz/FizzBuzz.cpp) - A group word game that prints integers from 1 to 100. If the number is divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz"; if the number is divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz"; and if both conditions are met, the output is "FizzBuzz."
- [Guess the Number](./programs/Guess%20the%20Number/GuessTheNumber.cpp) - The user must guess a mystery number and receive feedback on whether their guess is higher or lower than the mystery number.
- [Hangman](./programs/Hangman/Hangman.cpp) - A classic game in which the user must solve a secret word by guessing letters within a certain number of tries.
- [Luhn Algorithm](./programs/Luhn%20Algorithm/LuhnAlgorithm.cpp) - Determines whether the identification number provided by a user is accurate. The algorithm is most notably used in credit cards, IMEI, or SSN.
- [Rock Paper Scissors](./programs/Rock%20Paper%20Scissors/RockPaperScissors.cpp) - An intransitive hang game in which each player forms one of three shapes with their hand.
- [Temperature Converter](./programs/Temperature%20Converter/TemperatureConverter.cpp) - Converts an inputted temperature between 3 different temperature scales: Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin.
- [Tic-Tac-Toe](./programs/Tic-Tac-Toe/TicTacToe.cpp) - A simple game in which a user must win by getting 3 in a row with their shape: X or O.
- [Wordle](./programs/Wordle/Wordle.cpp) - A word game in which the user must guess a 5-letter word within 6 tries. The user receives feedback whether the letter is not in the word; in the word, but not in the correct position; or both in the word and in the correct position.
